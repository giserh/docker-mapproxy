    # ArcGIS clients can't connect on HTTP. Portal
    # ALWAYS redirects to port 443, so you HAVE TO listen there (via proxy)
    # Even then SOMETIMES it gives errors and refuses to let you create new
    # connections.  The error is
    # "'https://giscache.co.clatsop.or.us/county-aerials/service?SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetCapabilities'
    # is not accessible: Error. PKIX path building failed:
    # sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:

    # The ONLY workaround I have found when it's acting up is to use AGO-Assistant
    # to manually copy an existing service and then edit it.

    # For testing I want to be able to hit the server without any proxy, so, I do this
