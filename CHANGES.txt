With addition of a STATIC_IP_ADDRESS in docker-compose.yml, Docker
Swarm will no longer work. Sigh. So it's Docker Compose only for now.

Mapproxy is now at 1.14

There is now a CHANGES.txt file. :-)

There is no longer a "build" section in the compose file,
I expect to pull the automatically built image from Docker Hub
from now on.

Builds are done via the magic of Github Actions and pushed to Docker Hub.
